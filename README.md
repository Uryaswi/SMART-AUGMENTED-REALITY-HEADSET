# Smart-Augmented-Reality-Headset
## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, mobile phones and computers have become indispensable gadgets, shaping our daily lives. To make life smarter and more convenient, we have introduced a cutting-edge headset that integrates advanced smart features into a compact wearable device.
Our innovation leverages augmented reality smart glasses, a revolutionary technology that seamlessly overlays digital information onto the user’s physical environment, enriching perception and interaction. The system is designed to track and recognize objects in real-time, enabling intuitive on-the-go functionality.
To complement this, we have developed a user-friendly Android application that can effortlessly connect to laptops or mobile phones via Bluetooth in fiture, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free experience. This wearable device is designed to simplify everyday tasks, making it an essential companion for the tech-savvy generation.

## Tech Stack
### Hardware Requirement
1. Display Module
2. Local chipset 
3. Microphone
4. Camera
5. Microcontroller 
6. Power source

### Software Requirement
Operating System required: Android , windows 10 or 11
Programming language used – Java
Packages and library – Firebase ML Kit for image recognition ,

Volley library : Used specifically  for json parsing .

## Object Recognition and Tracking System
### Algorithm
Process of image recognition via the application:
Step 1: Initialize the app

Step 2: Connect app to firebaseAPI

Step 3: Application connects to the google database

Step 4: Fetching library

Step 5: Searches the database

Step 6: compares the database with the snapped image

step 7: when match found, image is recognized and it fetches the image description 

Step 8: Displays image description

## Use Cases
Personal Assistance: Identify objects in real-time and provide relevant information, making it an ideal tool for visually impaired individuals or for quick identification of unfamiliar items.

Retail and Shopping: Enhance shopping experiences with features like product recognition, price comparison, and the upcoming virtual try-on system for clothing, accessories, and eyewear.

Education and Training: Facilitate interactive learning by overlaying digital information on physical objects, such as anatomical models for medical students or machinery parts for engineering trainees.

Workplace Productivity: Enable hands-free object recognition and real-time data access, ideal for industrial environments, inventory management, and fieldwork operations.
Travel and Navigation:Offer real-time object recognition to identify landmarks, translate text on signage, or provide contextual information during tours.
## Future Enhancements
We are actively exploring additional use cases, including the development of a virtual try-on system for enhanced user interaction. Due to ongoing development, the source code is currently private.

## Acknowledgement
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Calcutta Institute of Engineering and Management for providing us with the opportunity to work on this project as part of our final year curriculum. Their guidance and support have been invaluable throughout this journey.
